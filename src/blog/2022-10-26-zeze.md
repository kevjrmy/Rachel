### EXTRAIT VIDÉO : 

Eleventy is not a JavaScript framework—that means zero boilerplate client-side JavaScript. We’re thinking long-term to opt-out of the framework rat race. The tool chain, modules, and components you use in your front end stack are decoupled from this tool. Work from a solid foundation of pre-rendered templates that suit your project’s progressive enhancement baseline requirements.
Eleventy works with your project’s existing directory structure and allows incremental adoption. You don’t need to start an Eleventy project from scratch. Eleventy is flexible enough to allow conversion of only a few templates at a time. Migrate as fast or as slow as you’d like.
Eleventy works great with data—use front matter and/or load from an API using data files to inject into your templates.
